<jared-w> Does it bug anyone else that you have to guess the package name if
	  you're given a list of imports and want to put them in a cabal file?
<sm> sure
<hpc> cabal init can figure it out to some extent		        [18:21]
<sm> stack script too, I think
<jle`> if the package is in scope, ghc should tell you what packages have a
       given import
*** wespiser (~wespiser@50.226.42.194) has quit: Ping timeout: 240 seconds

<jesyspa> Hi, I'm on Arch Linux and have had GHC installed for a while, and it

<jared-w> Arch Linux has started dynamically linking GHC and it's a pain in
	  the ass to get anything working with it. I recommend purging your
	  entire system of all GHC/haskell stuff and then using ghc-static (or
	  just pure stack)
*** cpup (~cpup@32.218.118.65) has quit: Ping timeout: 255 seconds

<jesyspa> Hmm, thanks, I'll take a look at that.		        [18:46]
<jared-w> koz_: no it's really the whole mess with dynaic linking. Haskell
	  expects static linked things and Arch forces dynamic linked
	  things. You need to explicitly tell GHC to expect dynamically linked
	  stuff or the linker won't be able to find anything

<[exa]> hm, yeah
<koz_> It also had the convenient effect of helping me see FRP in a new light.

<Axman6> that's the same as (\x -> x $ 5)
<thimoteus> it's infix notation, shorthand for \ f -> f $ 5
<Axman6> infix functions can be partially applied on either side

<anelson-> I'm not sure I'm making myself clear... I can use the repl just

	  ((:~:))

<anelson-> up to now I've just been working with js on the frontent, so

<anelson-> I'm excited to try out miso though...
<manek> nshepperd: I have to read all the linked papers. If then I still do
	not see it, I would kindly ask you for any simple example that is
	doable using :~: and is not doable using type families/classes 
<cocreature> anelson-: have you tried disabling optimizations? that often

<anelson-> cocreature: what were you talking about with running the repl in

<cocreature> anelson-: although 30s seems unreasonably slow. do you have a

<anelson-> If I do `cabal repl` and then run `:main`, it complains about

<manek> ertes-w: yes, I know it and I see how it brings values to typelevel
	here
<ertes-w> manek: see how the type variable 'a' in 'f' is fully polymorphic,
	  yet the implementation manages to view x as an Int in one equation

<anelson-> cocreature: just building with `cabal build`
<cocreature> anelson-: read the miso readme. you need to install socket.io and

<cocreature> the repl will tell you the address that you need to open
